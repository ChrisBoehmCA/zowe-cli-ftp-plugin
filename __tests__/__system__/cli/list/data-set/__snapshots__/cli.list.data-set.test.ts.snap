"================z/OS FTP LIST DATA-SET HELP===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   data-set | ds

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   List all data sets that match a DSLEVEL pattern (see help below).
   The following values can be used with the --response-format-filter (--rff)
   argument to display more data from the data sets:volume, unit, referred, ext,
   used, recfm, lrecl, blksz, dsorg, and dsname.

 USAGE
 -----

   bright zos-ftp list data-set <pattern> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   pattern		 (string)

      The pattern or patterns to match data sets against. Also known as 'DSLEVEL', it
      is somewhat similar to the concept of a 'glob' (but not identical). The
      following special sequences can be used in the pattern:
      %: Matches any single character
      *: matches any number of characters within a data set name qualifier (e.g.
      \\"ibmuser.j*.old\\" matches \\"ibmuser.jcl.old\\" but not \\"ibmuser.jcl.very.old\\")
      **: matches any number of characters within any number of data set name
      qualifiers (e.g. \\"ibmuser.**.old\\" matches both \\"ibmuser.jcl.old\\" and
      \\"ibmuser.jcl.very.old\\")
      However, the pattern cannot begin with any of these sequences.

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zftp-profile  | --zftp-p (string)

      The name of a (zftp) profile to load for this command execution.

 RESPONSE FORMAT OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --response-format-filter  | --rff (array)

      Filter (include) fields in the response. Accepts an array of field/property
      names to include in the output response. You can filter JSON objects properties
      OR table columns/fields. In addition, you can use this option in conjunction
      with '--response-format-type' to reduce the output of a command to a single
      field/property or a list of a single field/property.

   --response-format-type  | --rft (string)

      The command response output format type. Must be one of the following:

      table: Formats output data as a table. Use this option when the output data is
      an array of homogeneous JSON objects. Each property of the object will become a
      column in the table.

      list: Formats output data as a list of strings. Can be used on any data type
      (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry
      in an array.

      object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object).
      Can be used in place of \\"table\\" to change from tabular output to a list of
      prettified objects.

      string: Formats output data as a string. JSON objects/arrays are stringified.

      Allowed values: table, list, object, string

   --response-format-header  | --rfh (boolean)

      If \\"--response-format-type table\\" is specified, include the column headers in
      the output.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --response-format-json  | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help  | -h (boolean)

      Display help text


 EXAMPLES
 --------

   - List all data sets beginning with \\"ibmuser\\" and ending in
   \\"cntl\\":

      $ bright zos-ftp list data-set \\"ibmuser.**.cntl\\"
