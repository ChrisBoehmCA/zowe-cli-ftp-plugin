 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   spool-files-by-jobid | sfbj

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Given a z/OS job JOBID, list the spool files (DDs) for a z/OS job on the
   JES/spool queues. The command does not pre-validate the JOBID. The command
   presents errors verbatim from the z/OSMF Jobs REST endpoints.

 USAGE
 -----

   bright zos-ftp list spool-files-by-jobid <jobid> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   jobid		 (string)

      The z/OS JOBID of the job with the spool files you want to list. No
      pre-validation of the JOBID is performed.

 ---------------

   --zftp-profile  | --zftp-p (string)

      The name of a (zftp) profile to load for this command execution.

 RESPONSE FORMAT OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --response-format-filter  | --rff (array)

      names to include in the output response. You can filter JSON objects properties
      OR table columns/fields. In addition, you can use this option in conjunction
      with '--response-format-type' to reduce the output of a command to a single

      The command response output format type. Must be one of the following:

      table: Formats output data as a table. Use this option when the output data is
      an array of homogeneous JSON objects. Each property of the object will become a
      column in the table.

      list: Formats output data as a list of strings. Can be used on any data type
      (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry
      in an array.

      object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object).
      Can be used in place of \\"table\\" to change from tabular output to a list of
      prettified objects.

      string: Formats output data as a string. JSON objects/arrays are stringified.

      Allowed values: table, list, object, string

   --response-format-header  | --rfh (boolean)

      If \\"--response-format-type table\\" is specified, include the column headers in
      the output.
